## Data Analytics

This website uses two analytics services to understand how visitors interact with the site and to improve its content and usability:

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics processes usage data such as page views, device information, and IP addresses.

- IP addresses are anonymized before storage.  
- Analytics data is collected and processed **only after you have given your explicit consent**.  
- Data may be transferred to and processed on servers outside the European Union. Google relies on Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

### NoCookieAnalytics (NCA)

NoCookieAnalytics is a **cookieless, fully anonymous analytics service**. It collects **aggregated information only**, including:

- Page views and page paths  
- Referrers (encoded)  
- Device type, browser, and operating system  
- Basic interaction events (e.g., button clicks)  

**No personal data** (IP addresses, user IDs, cookies) is collected or stored. NCA works without your consent and automatically tracks site usage in a privacy-friendly way.

## Your Consent

Providing consent is voluntary. You may withdraw your consent for Google Analytics at any time. Withdrawal will prevent further Google Analytics data from being collected.

   onclick="localStorage.removeItem('ga_consent'); location.reload();">
Withdraw Google Analytics consent
</a>

**Note:** NoCookieAnalytics tracking does not require consent, as it does not collect personal data.
