## About Me

I am a research‑oriented engineer with experience across **Automatic Test Equipment**, **embedded systems**, **IoT technologies**, and **signal‑processing platforms**. My work focuses on understanding how complex hardware–software systems behave in real conditions, where timing, reliability, and computational efficiency are critical.

I enjoy working where practical engineering meets real world problem solving. I build prototypes, study how systems behave under different conditions, and refine architectures through hands on experimentation and test based developemnt. My experience in embedded and IoT systems has guided my interest in **secure**, **resilient**, and **high integrity computing**, especially in areas where **reliability** and **correctness** are essential.

I am currently based in **Stuttgart, Germany**.
